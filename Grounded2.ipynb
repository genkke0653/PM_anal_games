When I tried to start a game and invite some of my friends we got about 10 minutes in and then the game showed an error that said \"Lost connection to host, returning to menu.\" After I got that message I tried logging back in only to be stuck on the \"Logging in\" screen. The only way I could get out of the game was to alt+f4 which meant some progress was lost, which is fine because we weren't very far, however after I tried logging back into grounded I was met with the same screen which caused me to restart my pc, but when I got back on I couldn't log back into Steam, the bug literally broke Steam. This only happened for about 20 minutes but I had to relog into everything which kinda sucked but after that I got back into Steam and was able to continue playing without any problems. So all in all the game is really fun but the bugs are to be expected for day one early access.\n"

              "[\"My friends group and I have played dozens of Survival style games together. G2 seems to be a great game overall, runs well, graphics are good, decent combat, etc. The biggest issue is how they save group games. For a very long time we have always just paid to host private servers for our group play as that has proven the safest and most consistent. Ever other title we have played has this option but for some reason this is not an option for G2 (no private servers). They have a system to host and play together but it does not consistently work well. I play on a laptop and a desktop and can't even see my own saved multiplayer world on both PCs. For us its one of those things that's minor but also clearly a deal breaker. I have no idea why they can't just allow hosted servers. I will still play some when me friends aren't online or we aren't playing something else, just frustrating as I think this could be a lot of fun to play with our friends group.\",\n",

              " 'Obviously there is a lot to be done, but what is here so far is incredible. This is a HUGE improvement on the first game in many ways, primarily the variety of enemies and graphics. Wolf spider is especially beautiful (and scary) compared to the first.',\n",

              " 'A bit complicated to rate.\\n\\nFirst of all, I am someone who loved Grounded 1, played days on it from the early days, creating multiple base with triple layered walls and all possible things. Played on GamePass and bought it heere too for supporting the devs since i had a great time with it.\\nThis sequel is still not there.\\n\\nThe graphic is the same, although there had been some refining on a couple of monsters which are now more detailed, and the variety of bugs has been increased.\\nWe now have no zip line, but we can tame and ride a bug. In terms of movement speed, it is the same; although you get your riding pet almost immediately while the zip line would require some work for you to settle up and to prepare for the various locations.\\nThe problem with the bug riding is that it makes you feel extremely safe: you can run everywhere and no bug will ever catch you. It is definitely something negative when you compare it to Grounded 1 where your survival skill were put much more under pressure, specially in the early game where you couldn\\' run around like a fool, while now you can, also at night..\\nThey should make the riding pet afraid to get too close to predators, and maybe to panic and freeze or being unresponsive when caught in an ambush, rather then being better than Speedy.\\nAlso, another negative note is the Spider Wolf: it is now a territorial bug that won\\'t roam around and won\\'t spawn sometimes out of nowhere. There are just a couple that i have spotted although i haven\\'t yet seen the whole map. It is really a pity for both the scare factor and the survival element of the game.\\nThese beautiful labs which characterized Grounded 1 are not there. Not for now, at least. They have been replaced by less fascinating buildings.. There is less that catch the eye as well as it had been in Gounded 1 (viewpoint from the Maze, or the dome Underwater, if not the great lake with the towering Tree.. here we have nothing of that level, for now.)\\nAnother negative thing i noticed is the difficulty to see two bugs fight between them: if you try to be the clever dude and luring one bug to another to have them fight each other and you earning the spoils.. well, you can\\'t now.. the bugs are besically all neutral among themselves, and will always point you. Even when you try to shelter yourself behind a LadyBug (extreme case) they won\\'t attack the ladybug and will just move around her; while if you are mad enough to lure a spider wolf on another predator area, they won\\'t look at each other in the eye and will simple leave. Kinda sad. I remember when i used to make a road of lanterns because the spider wolf would follow the light at night, and i would make them fight with numerous mites to use them as tanks while i used the bow; or again, how i pitted the larvas against the ants.. nothing now matters.\\n\\nHowever, the map is pretty big, still under development, with biomas decently brought up.\\nBuilding Editor is still under development, although it seems it will be the same of Grounded 1 plus a couple of good introduction; as of now it is yet not fully the same as Grounded 1.\\nThe fight mechanics are the same of Grounded 1, and we have a couple addition in the equipment.\\nThe problem with the hitbox, the latching of the enemy\\'s attack that can pass through corners & distances (if you got in contact with them it is like they acquired the right to hit you, and the animation will happen 1 or 1.5 seconds later if you ran through them, at that point they are sure to land), or the bugs getting stuck through the surfaces (like, inside a rock, or below the level of the ground, and you will hear them but not see them, while they can pop once they attack; or they will fix their postion if you reload, perhaps) are common issues that this chapters drags from Grounded 1.\\n\\n\\nOverall, right now it is an attemp to a second lease on Grounded 1, with them trying to replicate the feeling without changing much (which is quite convenient, of course, but i love the game so i won\\'t complain about this), but they need a bit more to create some \"awe-point\".\\n\\nA thing i didn\\'t have in Grounded 1 and which i would love to see is a different type of \"punishment\" if you kill too many bugs of a type, in a specific area: like, if you kill all the spiders in a spot, that spot could be invaded by an absurd number of mosquitos; while if you kill too many ants or steal too many eggs from an hive, then a destructive amount of larvae will spread in numbers.. Thigs like these, playing around the balance of the enviroment, would really feel awesome to me.\\n\\n\\nHoooooooooooooooowever, as you can see, the vote is postive. \\nI am extremely criticising but i love this game/settings, and i will play this second chapter as well, maybe a bit less obsessively if they don\\'t improve it a bit, but given it is an early access it will happen for sure.\\nEven if i were to complain early access grounded 1 with this early access grounded 2, it still wins grounded 1 because the labs there were amazing and the spider wolf would be devastating.\\n\\nBut this game is good, not as much, but good. If you loved Grounded 1, this is now descreet/good level.\\nI hope it will become even more, like its predecessor.',\n",

              " \"**DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THE 1ST GAME**\\n\\nI adore Grounded, I've put well over 250 hours into the 1st iteration and it is wonderful in so many ways, a fresh take on a redundant genre. I bought it not knowing if I would enjoy it, but eventually fell in love. Knowing a 2nd Grounded would be on the way got me REALLY excited! And yeah, if you are here for more Grounded, Grounded 2 is literally more of it in every way with some fun additions. My hope was that even what was available in early access would be on par with the full release of the 1st Grounded. Unfortunately, that is not the case.\\n\\nJust to be clear here: if you are a super fan, you are going to enjoy what is available in early access here, you will want more, but you will enjoy it. I got about 35 hours out of what is currently here and enjoyed it. I love the buggies, I love the new insects, the new world, it still feels good. It is missing the depth of exploration the 1st game brought with it because it isn't fully fleshed out, but I see the skeleton and am willing to hold my deepest criticisms until they get the opportunity to fulfill their design. If that doesn't work for you, don't get this right now.\\n\\nIf you have never played Grounded, playing Grounded 2 is going to make you wonder what the hype is all about, so I HIGHLY recommend going back to the 1st and playing that. Maybe by the time yo wrap that up, this one will have more to entice you. Please don't ruin your impression of how wonderful these games are by hopping in on the 2nd game. I know that seems like a strange way to invite you in, but I'm so confident you will adore the 1st game that I want you to go there first and come back here later.\\n\\nMany bugs as it stands:\\nVery, VERY rough optimization (coming from someone that doesn't give a shit about graphical propensity and such) but I've tested this game on multiple systems and it just can't handle it's own graphical settings.\\n\\nEnemies popping in & out of the landscape, attacking you through the ground, getting stuck on terrain, etc.\\n\\nQuality of life changes from the 1st game that have been removed, you only have 1 hotbar and cannot cycle through multiple as you could in the 1st game, there are no Mutation hotswaps so you have to enter the menu and manually change your loadout in the heat of battle, very silly thing to remove\\n\\nCollectively, these problems severely weaken the fun that can be had, particularly if you were used to what the 1st game brought to the table.\\n\\nSome of the areas are clearly not fully fleshed out, you can tell where the temporary finish line was for most of the endgame that is available here. There are areas that intend to challenge you with puzzles or combat that just haven't been worked on, like after fighting one of the big bugs in the tower. You have to turn on 3 switches which offers  different routes, none of which offer any challenge, any fight, or any puzzles; you simply walk down 3 hallways and flip the switches. What the hell? Why sidetrack players for  minutes to hit some buttons to unlock a door? Just give us a key after killing the boss. Again, I think they haven't fully fleshed out things like this, and there are multiple instances of this, which is frustrating, but EARLY ACCESS REMEMBER!!!\\n\\nThese are the biggest complaints off the top for me. There are a multitude of smaller inconveniences but they aren't a big deal.\\n\\nAnyhow, play the 1st game if you have never played Grounded, if you are here after the 1st game, be prepared for more of what you loved, just not at the same caliber or quality of the original. \\n\\nI believe Obsidian will update this game and make it way better than the original, I really do. The skeleton is here, it just needs more time in the oven. But right now it doesn't hold a candle to the original, just be aware of that. This will eclipse the OG once it is complete, but that is a LONG way off.\",\n",

Wait. \\n\\nI understand that it\\'s early access, but frankly, the term \"early access\" has become too broad nowadays, and I think this game sets a perfect example of why. I fall just short of the recommended specs, admittedly, with my CPU, but I\\'m still running this game on a 3090 and getting lag and REALLY BAD stuttering on both high and medium graphics settings. Compounding this issue is the complete lack of graphical options---right now you can only choose from presets, you can\\'t tweak individual settings. \"Early Access\" games should at least be PLAYABLE and STABLE. The whole point of early access is to get community feedback on the CONTENT, not the stability of your game. Granted, this game isn\\'t the WORST offender when it comes to this, but it doesn\\'t change the fact that we need to change this standard of releasing games too early and slapping an \"Early Access\" label on them. This game could\\'ve easily used another 2-3 months in development before releasing, I mean, come on. \\n\\nThe visuals are iffy for me. I love the more detailed looks of all the bugs, and I appreciate how they kept the general look of the game intact from the first one. But MAN, what happened to the color grading? The whole thing feels so incredibly washed out and the lighting is so harsh that it genuinely strains my eyes to look at it. \\n\\nAll in all, if you\\'re a fan of the first one, yes, I think you will enjoy this one. But I\\'d wait. The devs, to their credit, are working hard on optimization fixes right now. But to charge $30 for a game that\\'s extremely unstable (and was FAR worse on day one) is just...yeah. I\\'d just wait if I were you. I\\'ll definitely play it multiplayer with my friends, but until they optimize this game, I\\'m gonna hold off on any solo-playthroughs.',\n",

It's playable, but I was also born into the lag, molded by it - I've seen significantly worse and this was absolutely playable. Although if you're spoiled and can only play at 4K on your movie screen with ultra instinct mode graphics because youre far too sophisticated to drop your settings, don't know what to tell you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]Things I want[/b]\\r\\n\\r\\n1. In the future, allow us to build nearly anywhere - especially the ice cream cart (or at least on the ice cream outside the cart). It's way too amazing of a biome to just be a dungeon. Also, allow us to fully negate Chilled instead of slowing it with a proper build.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. More random, small landmarks scattered throughout. Currently, the existing map feels rather bland and empty. This is most likely due to the size I feel however, having more random toys and such would make it feel a lot more interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Ant mount scales with your axe upgrade. Feels bad having to jump off just to gather a higher level stem.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Way, WAY too many Scorpions. They are EVERYWHERE. I hope they're just placeholder for the future. The ice cream cart in specific felt so bizzare being filled with them. They need switched with something else entirely. Make them more rare and also, they need buffed - they're just so weak even at the largest size.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Wolf Spider needs more move variety. In general, the original bugs need more randomness and new moves added to their kit. Veterans can walk in and kill one naked essentially.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Future mounts - I'd really like a praying mantis... and a snail, for fun... not so much... practicality. \\r\\n\\r\\n7. Weather\\r\\n\\r\\n8. More random events, not necessarily even interactive, but just things like the Crow, or maybe a squirrel that drops nuts off a tree, things of that nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nI played Grounded 1 the second the first playable state was released, and I'm here again.

The new characters and story also have my attention (Sloane Beaumont cracks me up.) Sure, there's a long way to go--and I'm incredibly excited to see where it goes--but I've already got my money's worth at launch, easy.\\n\\nOne last mention about the first Grounded--I remember when Obsidian released the 1.0 update. A friend and I had been coming back and rerunning the game with every meaningful update, and we had watched the game grow in size and scope a good bit before being absolutely blown away by one more meaningful, massive update to cap it all off. Then, Obsidian didn't cap it all off--releasing several more meaningful updates even after that. What I'm getting at is, Obsidian did early access *right.* Maybe better than any other dev in my experience, and survival is my favorite genre (aka I play a lot of early access lol).\\n\\nSo, yeah, I can acknowledge this one has its rough spots currently. It's early access, and I'm writing this week one--it'd be weird if it didn't.

Grounded 2 is the perfect mix of survival, base building, crafting, and souls-like elements in one of the most unique and enjoyable settings ever. \\r\\n\\r\\nGoing up against colossal bugs as you explore the park is exhilirating. You are both rewarded and punished for exploring, where following the story is probably the safer path, but my god is it fun to go off the beaten path and just wander around the massive open world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombat is very strategic and can be quite challenging. Knowing and exploiting enemy weaknesses actually makes a massive difference, and having the right gear and consumables is essential.\\r\\n\\r\\nI normally hate souls-like games with punishing difficulty, but so far Grounded 2 has felt challenging, but not unbearable. I never feel like I'm bashing my head against a wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, single player I haven't experienced too many bugs. I think I've crashed 2-3 times, and had a couple issues where I'll jump, bounce off something, and going flying 100 meters into the air. But for a world this size and density, I'm pretty surprised how fluid everything seems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe graphics are fantastic and fit the style of game to a T. Climbing up a vista and looking out over the park is a thing of beauty and really gives a sense of awe to the vastness of the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside is that since it's early access, only a portion of the game is available. Most people will burn through the content in a matter of days, so keep that in mind. Still, even if they never added another thing to this game, it is EASILY worth $30.\",\n",

Anyone leaving a negative review because of it should take the time to reconsider buying early access games in the future. The point is to play and help the devs make it better. But apart from some low frames, a few crashes and an issue launching the game (which was very easy to fix) i think the game plays pretty decent for an initial early access release.\\n\\nAll in all grounded 2 is turning out great. Its like the excitement of the first one is being relived all over again times 10! A very fun foundation to build upon with years of exciting content releases to look forward to. I cant wait for fall and the first major update. Playing this game in the fall just gives me a sense of well being.\\n\\nIf you loved grounded 1 you will love this.

              " \"Super Fun! might be as fun as Grounded One. Performance is A little bad on max graphics, but it is a pre-release game, so I honestly don't know what people are complaining about. \\r\\n\\r\\nThings I like: Omni-tool doesn't take up 4 slots in your inventory. The design of some of the areas is super cool, both visually and in-game level design. New bugs are super fun to fight and look amazing, plus the redesigns look so incredible. I love the new class system. I feel like all of the classes have some great team synergies with each other, and all have fun things to do, creative armor, and weapons too. Concepts for this game are so inventive. I have always wanted a snow area in Grounded, but I couldn't think of how they could have done it but the ice box is such a creative way for this to just be a single section of the map and still have it be snowy themed. \\r\\n\\r\\nComplaints: The omni-tools feel sluggish to use, and I would honestly just like it better if it were a single tool that could swap modes, because just holding E on something doesn't feel good. The map is big, but it has things in the very corners of it, which causes it to be kinda hard to find stuff. Buggies tend to just disappear with your items inside, which can be annoying if you want to have buggies because you have to go back into a cave to get an egg, then wait 11 minutes for it. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, would recommend this game to anyone who had fun in the first game. Obsidian is honestly one of the best game dev teams ever, creating games like Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds, and Pentiment.

              " 'I will probably update my review after more play and updates, but so far I really like it. It\\'s a shame that all the comments complaining about optimization have been voted to the top. It\\'s usually some variation of comparing this game to Grounded 1. Sorry, but your 2080 is 3 generations behind and you\\'re going to need to update your rig at some point. This is a 2025 AAA game and it\\'s just going to use more resources. Could the optimization be better? Sure. And I know the developers will be working on that, but this is the cost of innovation. As better graphics engines come out, developers can\\'t be expected to keep producing to the lowest denominator. If that was the case, we\\'d still have 8-bit games. Ok, rant over.\\n\\nAside from a few crashes and bugs, the game plays really well in early access. My biggest issues are with three categories of the mechanics of the game: Combat, Inventory Management, and Building.\\n\\nCOMBAT\\nThe combat mechanic updates are great. In Grounded 1, I found myself really avoiding combat because it just wasn\\'t fun. The new mechanics make combat a worthwhile endeavor, and as others have said, I find myself approaching combat differently. Even in the early game, it\\'s possible to be strategic and take down bigger bugs. I feel like the aiming mechanic is really spotty however. For example, if you\\'re using a melee weapon, it\\'s not uncommon to miss a bug (particularly a smaller bug) if you don\\'t aim super precisely. The reticle for aiming is really small, but with something like a club, it should really be a bigger area of impact. This makes some of the combat a little clunky. Hit registry also feels a little off. \\n\\nINVENTORY MANAGEMENT\\nManaging inventory is a little cumbersome. I often find my quick slots empty for no apparent reason. Things like switching between a torch and a shield, or from a single-handed item to a dual-handed item do weird things with the slots, and I\\'ve found myself having to actually go into the inventory view in high-pressure situations because the item I needed wasn\\'t where it should be. \\n\\nI love the buggy mechanic, especially as it relates to making construction easier (which I will get to in my next section), but managing the buggy\\'s stack-carrying (the buggy can carry 10 grass planks or weed stems at a time) is clunky. There should be a way to just have the buggy drop items, rather than having to grab a few at a time and unload them or huck them. \\n\\nFinally, picking up items is frustrating. Especially small items like sap, or pebblets. These items also suffer from the aim mechanic issue, where if you are not super precise, you miss the pickup. Battle royale games do a really good job on item pickup (Fortnite, Warzone, etc.). The pickup dynamic should not be tied to the aiming mechanic, and it should be easier to pick up small items. I also feel like the game has a really hard time with \"stacked\" items (where there are a bunch of items clustered together). There should be a way to pick up the item you want without having to find the perfect angle to get around everything else.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION\\nThe construction mechanic is helped immensely by the new buggies. Unfortunately, placement of walls, furniture, workbenches, etc. is really frustrating. Trying to \"snap\" walls together leads to weird placement on uneven terrain, where it is not unusual to have a wall get buried in the ground rather than follow the natural slope. Placing constructed items kind of reminds me of Sims 2, and not in a good way. It feels like a very old mechanic for a game with such stunning visuals. Placement should align better with the terrain.\\n\\nOverall though, I am very pleased with where this game is in early access. If you have a 3080 or above, which is what you should be using for a AAA game in 2025, the game should be playable for you and even enjoyable. I can\\'t wait to see where this goes!',\n",

The world feels alive, full of little details and surprises that make exploring really rewarding. The story builds nicely on the original and the gameplay mechanics are even smoother this time around.\\n\\nI definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Grounded 1 — or even newcomers who love survival and adventure games. That said, there’s still some room for improvement, especially in terms of graphics.

The biggest thing I want out of this game right now though that I want to see addressed is the implementation of advanced graphics settings, as well as performance optimizations to resolve memory leakages that have been causing game crashes for me. (and yes, this game does crash, be warned.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that said, the game is a lot of fun. I've been playing it for a bit now, gotten to experiment with the buggies and the new and improved combat system. Combat feels really good (when it works, which it does about 75-80% of the time. sometimes there are hitbox issues, or in multiplayer there's desync) The buggies are a lot of fun, and I can't wait to see what Obsidian does with buggies in the future as they further develop the game. (seeing buggy mutations in the roadmap brings me great joy) The game remains as good looking as the first game, with some creatures being noticably creepier than their first-game counterparts. Building is just as great as it was in the first game, and base building feels a lot better with how much more open the new map is, since it's easier to find a spot of land that's suitable for a decent base of operations with plenty of ground space. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun, and if you're okay with the problems that come with an early-access title, the game is great to pick up and it's a ton of fun--and absolutely an improvement on the first game.\",\n",

The upgrading of that tool, and the fact that i don't need to fill a hotbar and half of my inventory with shovels and stuff is very good. The graphics are perfect and there is an obvious increase of quality in the bugs.

              " 'Right Upfront I want to preface by saying this review will only be valid until the next content update in which I will remake the review so make sure to check the editing date. I have also not tried multiplayer so this is a single-player experience review.\\n\\nI love this game.\\n\\n*Spoilers*\\n\\nPros:\\n- Unlike a lot of people I have seen, I have not been having many performance problems excluding one crash when I was exiting the game. However, this is only after adjusting the settings to play on a slightly lower graphic setting which I think needs to be a more acceptable common ground for some of the reviews I have read who only want to play the game on high graphics. I understand it may not be that way for everyone and I an sure that more optimization needs to be done but considering the fact that it works for my mid-low end PC pretty fine makes future updates for this game seem very bright.\\n- THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL. I cannot understate how fun it is just to look around. All of the models have been tweaked and look great compared to even the first game (Which I also think is pretty)\\n- Enemies are intimidating. First time seeing the larger scorpion enemy I had the same reaction as to when I saw the first wolf spider in grounded 1. Pure Terror. A++\\n- Omni-Tool is a good change. by the end of the first game, there just so many things you always need to carry around and repair and it was getting annoying. Subtracting 4 from the \"Crap you need to carry\" list is a welcome change even if parts of it aren\\'t fully ironed.\\n- Class system is nice when thinking about weapon economy. I feel as though toward the end of grounded one you were carrying all kind of weapons around all the time and it took up so much space. The more streamlined class system to me feels like it allows for a less cluttered approach to making a good build that you can always use and diversify.\\n- More armors will always be fun.\\n- More weapons will always be fun.\\n- The map is huge, creating lots of things to discover and interact with and lots of unique biomes to explore and fight through.\\n- Buggies are super fun to use. I named my ant Anton and I haven\\'t came up with a cool Orb Weaver name yet but he is just chilling at base rn. They making navigating so much better without zip-lines and they are fun to have at your side. I usually prefer to hop off my buggy to fight larger enemies because I play a perfect block build that is more rewarding for ME to parry but then I just hop back on after the fight and keep cruising.\\n- Dungeons and Mini-bosses are a must for future updates because they are cool. The Toxic Anthill Dungeon was very fun and cool thing to just discover.\\n- Every new creature fits right into the cast and I can\\'t wait to see which ones they add next.\\n- This game (and what future updates will make it) for $30 is a steal. Being cheaper than the first game with already a comparable amount of content and the promise of significantly more in the future is insane and greatly appreciated in a world of $90 video games\\n- I am sure there are more Pros I can and will think of but these are some of the highlights and I need to move on.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Perfect Blocking feels a little unrewarding. This is very caveman brain of me but I liked the old sound from grounded 1 and I haven\\'t been hearing it when I perfect block. Can we bring that back please?\\n- Dashing is almost useless in all but the final fight and is harder to remember to use than it is useful in combat.\\n- Spiderlings/Orb jr are EVERYWHERE. I have been trying to find a base location that is not constantly plagued by small annoying bugs but I cannot do it. There aren\\'t too many spawn locations on the map, they just respawn so quickly after you kill them and it is very annoying. Some of the best locations to potentially build a base are just plagued by the small arachnids all day and all night. It is very annoying and rate at which they spawn and respawn should be looked at in future updates.\\n- Bugs using blocking mechanics is cool but their AI should be looked at when it comes to it. I want them to really be fighting me with wit and not just holding up block for 6 seconds until I hit them with a heavy attack.\\n- Some bugs don\\'t seem useful enough and some areas seem very unused. Hard to explain this one but if you play it for a while you might understand what I am saying here.\\n- It\\'s possible there are more but idk this game is really good.\\n\\nI now just want to make suggestions for features that I think would be cool if added to the game and if I predict anything in this review it acts as a time capsule to say \"I called it!\"\\n- Subterranean Area. Large part of map that has an above ground and below ground area that can be lived in, built in, and accessible through small tunnels and a large central opening. Similar in style to Undershed but with a large opening exposed to the outside world. Gives kinda an Ark: Aberration vibe.\\n- Significantly more enemies. Even if a lot of them don\\'t do or drop much, having more diversity on the map as far as harmless and fleeing or neutral bugs would be very cool.\\n- Faction Activity other than raids. I think decimating a particular type of enemy should be rewarding or punishing. Say when you start killing a lot of larva in an area, their numbers around the map dwindle down and you see them less often for a while. But then if you don\\'t kill enough of a particular bug their numbers swell right before they would attack you. If you kill at a lot of bugs at that point you can lessen their numbers and avoid a raid.\\n- Moth buggy. A lot of people have suggested this for buggy so I am not special. But I think this should be accomplished through nontraditional methods... Raising the caterpillar. late in the game you should learn that the caterpillars are going to turn into gigantic moths and if you raise them correctly you can tame and ride it.\\n- Centipedes and millipedes are obvious wants for this game. Centipedes could be a huge boss fight while millipedes could be a gentle and touchable giant. both would be cool for the game.\\n- A dragonfly boss is obviously really cool and Dragonfly nymphs could be added to the pond area.\\n- Actual cyborg bugs if Ominent turns out to be evil again would be neat.\\n\\nLots of other things would be cool but I am just very excited to see the future of this game because the Early Access is great and I love the Grounded team.',\n",

Honestly, the Founders Pack is the only way I know how to say thank you. The first game is a masterpiece.\\n\\nI got to experience it with my dad and cousins for the first time ever. We all played together and had a blast. Friends I rarely see were always down to kick back and play Grounded. My best friend and I even played during his work shifts when things were slow. Solo runs felt like a real challenge, and it even helped with my fear of spiders. Not cured, but enough that fire became my best friend.\\n\\nNow the second game just dropped. It’s in Early Access. It’s not perfect and it’s not supposed to be. I’ve seen people complain about the graphics. Here’s my advice: go online, tweak your settings, and be realistic. Performance might not be flawless right now. I had high ping during long sessions, especially late at night, but it was manageable. Just takes some patience.\\n\\nVisually, the game still looks great. Having knowledge from the first game made this one feel fresh. Not like I was repeating things, but like I was stepping into a new area I’ve never seen before. That feeling of discovering the unknown is still very much there.\\n\\nWater is harder to find in some areas, but they added a multi-tool that helps with that. I appreciate that. Also, I can't count how many times I’ve thrown tools by accident just trying to switch between them, so any improvements there are welcome.\\n\\nBottom line: be patient. Let the devs do their thing. Don’t trash the game just because it doesn’t run at 200+ FPS on your 4090. Grow up. It’s Early Access.\\n\\nI love this game and I’m hyped for what’s coming.

              " \"Its pretty similar to the first game, and the additions like the buggy are cool, but a lot of the game feels worse than the first one. The tool being automatic takes a lot of fun out of resource gathering. In the first game, you could cancel you animations while gathering things, and the combo system with the tools made it more interactive to cut things down. In the new game, you just hold a button and point at a grass stalk and it is brought down eventually. Its a lot less fun than actually attacking the grass. I think what would help this is making the tool an actual thing you hold in your hand that you attack with, while still being an inventory-less item. The idea of streamlining the tools is good in theory, but in practice it just feels boring. The music is also not as good as the first game. Often, I'll be fighting a spiderling and the music that's playing will seem like it's for a giant spider or ladybug. The music doesn't really match up with what I'm doing. This wasn't perfect in the first game, but it was better. The lighting is also not good. In full sun, its blindingly bright, and during the night time without a torch, its pitch black. The lighting needs to be toned down in both directions. Performance is also an issue. The map is about the same size of the first game, but it regularly gives me 18-20 FPS on the lowest setting, while the first game gave my 50-60 on high. There's also not a lot of options for toning down graphics, just texture quality and resolution. I'd really like to be able to tone down the shading. Overall, its a worthy sequel, but it needs a lot of work to be up to par.\",\n",

The second iteration does not disappoint even in early release. A lot of great improvements, bigger area to explore (I haven\\'t even explored 1/10 of the map yet, so much to do!). I love the new mount system and the tutorial at the beginning was a huge plus. This feels like a brand new game with brand new content, but still a lot of things I loved about the first. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, PC users beware....FPS rates were super low at start.

I am sure the devs are working on a patch for PC (I hope) to resolve this issue, but in case it doesn\\'t drop for a bit, you may want to check your settings before complaining or asking for a refund. Can\\'t wait to see the final version of this game!',\n",
              " 'Off to a pretty decent start so far. For better or worse, if you\\'ve played the first Grounded, going back into this one is going to feel, mostly, like riding a familiar bicycle. If you were hoping to see it dramatically shaken up, you may be disappointed, as this is definitely more of an iterative sequel. The first game had some of the best survival game UX I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing though, so I\\'m personally happy the wheel hasn\\'t been too heavily reinvented. The story also directly continues the plot of the first game, which is great in its own right, so I would definitely recommend turning right back around and getting that first if you haven\\'t already played it. Besides a new story and setting, some new mechanics are added, including the much-trumpeted ability to recruit and ride bug buddies (or \"buggies\" - man that\\'s cute).\\n\\nSomething that caught me off guard a bit is the consolidation of tools. Most survival games seem to expect you to have certain resource-gathering tools on your person at *strictly all times* - but still tax you inventory/hotbar space for it, even though it\\'s not the player\\'s fault these are essential. This intrusion\\'s gone now. You still craft and upgrade tools, but in the form of upgrades to a special \"omnitool\" that doesn\\'t take up an inventory slot and can be used to harvest any resources, as long as the specific function for that resource has been upgraded sufficient. These are also shared across players, so there are no awkward transitional stages in multiplayer where only one person can harvest particular resources and everyone else is limited to just pointing them out until they get the upgrade. On the other hand, you\\'re a little more limited in where you can harvest resources, as you have to stand right next to a specific spot on them and hold the corresponding button to harvest. Also, the introduction of the omnitool in the tutorial is a little confusing, as players of the previous game (or most survival games) will probably expect to see it as an inventory item, and in multiplayer, it\\'s given to all players without making it explicit that everyone got it, which might leave the additional players confused as to how to obtain it (without knowing they already have it). This is a very minor thing, but there was also a bit more visual personality to the original tools that\\'s missing a bit with this generic looking wrench-axe-hammer thing. But overall I\\'m glad it\\'s here - it helps trim out some inconvenience without actually reducing the challenge factor.\\n\\nThere are some UI elements that seem to just not be full implemented yet. For example, hotbar slots can still contain a category of item instead of a specific item, allowing them to automatically pull in items of the appropriate type so that you don\\'t have to manually re-assign them every time you run out of one kind of item and want to use another. However, these are lost as soon as you assign a specific item to a hotbar slot - and there seems to be no way to re-assign them yet. And all the complaints about optimization seem largely justified. On an RTX 4080 Super, some of the animations (like other players\\' punches or attacks) can be claymation-level jerky, and some input lag and frame rate drops are noticeable on High. I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see this improve over updates, but right now it\\'s not great. Graphics customization options are limited to a set of presets as well, so there\\'s very little capacity for fine-tuning performance to improve it.\\n\\nAs a big fan of the original game who mainly just wanted a new story and some expansions and refinements to the mechanics I already liked, so far it\\'s delivering what I asked for and I\\'m having a great time. But the early access state is more than just incomplete content here. There are definitely some core, foundational aspects in need of ironing out. If you weren\\'t already breaking out the trumpets and banners for this sequel\\'s Early Access release, you might have a better time waiting for this to cook, but if you can\\'t keep your hands off of it and need it now, there\\'s still fun to be had. But you may want to make sure you\\'ve got a modern GPU if you\\'re not going to wait on the (hopefully upcoming) performance improvements, and be prepared for a litany of potential bugs, from player HUD indicators disappearing to missing level geometry.

The developers have taken what needed to be improved from the last game and improved it and added new bugs and features along the way which i think is amazing. In addition, this game is really cheap compared to other new game which have this much content.\\n\\nMy only problem with this game is that its not that greatly optimised, and in my opinion its missing a lot of graphics settings.\",\n",
              " \"6/10. Mixed feelings. I don't hate the game, but its changed a lot from Grounded 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor context, I'm a 100+ hour Grounded 1 Woah Mode player, with combat as my main focus in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, performance. I struggled to get a consistant 60 FPS with an RTX 4060 GPU and a Ryzen 5 5600 CPU, 16GB of memory. To get this framerate, I'm playing on 1920x1080, Low graphics, 80% resolution. This performance is really bad for a midrange PC.\\r\\nI believe its the lighting engine's fault, because the FPS is quite stable at night. At this time theres no way to change the lighting quality or turn off shaders. I personally don't like the lighting too much, its very high in contrast, so its quite overwhelming, and as a light sensitive person I'm feeling quite sick after 2 hours of play.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, I like the combat changes, but they need refinement. Without going too much into detail, enemies can block, and you need to charge attack to get through it, but the charge time for charge attacks are way too long and the enemy can drop guard and attack before its ready. Besides that, the new dodge feature is fantastic, I don't think it has iFrames, but it goes far and is fun to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps this is a nitpick, but I do not like the new UI. the buttons for different tabs is small and tucked away in the top right, and instead of a one button to deposit stack like we used to have, you now need to hold E, which makes putting away new items more annoying. I don't understand these changes, it slows down inventory management and menuing a lot.\\r\\nTheres also no customization for ScaB's anymore, the color of your UI is based on your character and can't be changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, buggies and the omni-tool. I'm a person who doesn't like mounts, pets, and companions, and I was very worried when they announced buggies that they would not be optional, and it turns out those fears were justified. Some tasks require buggies to complete, and the map is so large that going anywhere on foot is quite a long journey. This is quite disappointing.\\r\\nThe omni-tool was another thing I was worried about, and I think that ones okay. It doesn't feel very great that my axes are gone as that was a personal favorite weapon, and it doesn't feel great that I have to hold E to harvest resources instead of clicking, its lacking the feeling of weight the old tools used to have. But atleast it still has the spirit of progression like the old tools had.\",\n",
              " \"I played Grounded 1 soon after it launched in EA years back, so I was with it from the start; and it was incredible to see it grow and evolve.\\n\\nAnd now I'm back at Day 1 with Grounded 2 in EA.\\n\\nBiggest complaint I'd have for the game, really the only complaint in fact, is the performance - much like a lot of people have been saying. My PC is able to run Grounded 1 no problem, but I've had to really dumb down the graphics in order to get it to run somewhat decently, which admittedly impairs the experience a bit.\\n\\nThat being said, this is again, an Early Access game, and is currently at Day 1 launch; and I have complete faith that the performance issues will be addressed soon.\\n\\nThe positives are numerous.\\n\\nIf you loved 1, you'll love this. It literally feels like coming back to the first game again, but with a new world to explore and new bugs to face off against. They've reused a lot of the same assets from 1, which is perfectly fine with me and seems to me an intelligent move overall. There was nothing wrong with the assets from the first game, and the similarities help to make a fan of the first game feel right at home from the get go.\\n\\nIf you loved having all the individual tools (axe, hammer, shovel), you might be sad to hear that they've done away with those completely in favour of the Omni-tool, which is bound to a single button and will just active accordingly depending on what resource node you're trying to harvest - and you still upgrade it using bug parts.\\nSo the tools lose a bit of their colour there, but the stream-lining of resource gathering is still much appreciated - you don't need to worry about the tools taking up space, don't need to worry about it being left behind since the Omni-tool doesn't use an inventory slot and is always with you. \\nIt also doesn't have any durability either, so you don't need to worry about maintaining it. So while its a bit of a bummer to see the unique-looking tools get shelved, there's plenty of positives to make-up for it.\\n\\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game, just keep in mind, this is Early Access, there's gonna be issues, and you might need to play on reduced graphics for a decent frame-rate; but these issues are gonna get addressed in time, as with any EA game.\",\n",

Swinging it toward resources like in the first game was MUCH more satisfying and a lot quicker too, this makes gathering grass and the like a LOT slower than in the early stage of the first game. \\n\\n-Performance: it runs MUCH worse than the first game, it could really use a lot of optimization. I have a relatively low end PC (was mid some 5 years ago), which runs the first game at max fps without an issue, but I can barely squeeze 40 fps out of this one at mid level graphics. \\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s an early access, but honestly I feel like the devs had a lot more resources, time and knowledge about what players wanted from the get go this time around, and they could have released a more fleshed out game.

The different biomes were not as different from each other as it was the case in the first game, other than the snow biome which was a similar experience to the sandbox.\\n\\nStory : less enticing than the first iteration, but fine.\\n\\nBugs : they're fun an all, the large amount of O.R.C. bugs gives a little variety, but you can see the devs were crazy about their new scorpions (which are one of the few new additions) and ran with it. They're EVERYWHERE in large quantities. We got fed up with them.\\n\\nNevertheless, since it's so faithful to the first which was the gold standard in its genre, it's still an enjoyable experience, very user friendly even if, as a PC player, you feel a lot of limitations linked to the console UI, and I can't wait for the next stages of the game.\",\n",

Now, I know I don't have the best graphics card in the world (RX 6600), but for being on low settings, I feel I shouldn't be experiencing as many fps drops as I am. It also doesn't help that I have little to no control over said graphics settings. Just a bunch of pre-set ones.\\n    However, our complaints don't mean the game is bad. It's been wonderful so far, and it seems like it will continue to be so as it gets updates. I'm personally hoping to see what they do with the new omni-tool they added.

              " 'This game is NOT in a good state at release. I really care for this game, and I\\'m going to share everything that needs to be worked on, in order of priority.\\n\\n(Obviously) Performance: Basically no one can play the game at the moment because the game won\\'t start or the game doesn\\'t perform well, it\\'s because the graphics got better but Obsidian never made any optimizations to the game to compensate, they even removed the option to use optimization settings like FSR. I know that Obsidian isn\\'t very familiar with optimizing their games (or at least the Grounded division isn\\'t; On low-end computers in Grounded 1 the game wouldn\\'t run well at all), but that doesn\\'t excuse the fact that due to this game\\'s release, Obsidian just seems like they are oblivious to the fact that non-NASA computers exist and would be used to play this game. Obsidian should absolutely drop their entire roadmap just to make sure that they optimize this game to it\\'s absolute limit (or at least to an acceptable degree).\\n\\nMultiplayer: I don\\'t have friends so I didn\\'t get to test this but, from what I heard, the peer-to-peer connections don\\'t work properly, the Obsidian devs were even getting embarrassed by this on their launch live stream.\\n\\n(The rest of the review is going to be about the game itself so if you don\\'t want spoilers or whatever, you can read the summary and move on).\\n\\nQuality of Life: Grounded 1 has TONS of quality of life changes like the game pausing while looking at your inventory in single player, and buttons that were rebound reflect the changes in the UI (For Example, I rebound glide from LShift to Space and it still says LShift to glide in the UI). Both are present in Grounded 1. There is NO reason why they aren\\'t present in Grounded 2.\\n\\nOmni-tool: I think the omni-tool is a great addition on paper. In practice, Obsidian handled it pretty poorly in my opinion. The omni-tool is fine if it stayed he way it is, but I think it should be like the pickaxe in Fortnite: There is a dedicated button to equip it and the player must use it normally. I think it should be like that because of input overlap. For example, if a bug dies near a blade of grass you have to cut down the grass in order to interact with the dead bug. Maybe this suggestion could be added as a setting or something but it\\'s a long shot with everything that Obsidian has on their plate right now. \\n\\nCommon explanations for the poor launch:\\n\\n\"The game is in early access, so stop nagging about the poor launch!\"\\nThis isn\\'t Obsidian\\'s first game, this isn\\'t even the first game in the series, they know how to make a good Grounded game because they\\'ve done it before, so the state of this game is baffling and frustrating. If the devs told us that the game was made by a team of amateurs, I would believe them.\\n\\nSummary: I think this is another case of Microsoft wanting this game out on a certain date and Obsidian didn\\'t have enough time to polish the game because of things forced on them like the founder\\'s pack. But I could be completely wrong because no one really knows at the moment. All we know is that this game had a very poor launch and we hope that this game has a Street Fighter 5 redemption story.

They seemed to revert the game\\'s graphics back to Grounded 1\\'s. They also changed the taskbar icon from a blue soldier ant to the icon for \"crunch\" in-game.\\n\\nHotfix 0.1.1.2: They fixed a crash when using multiplayer/crossplay, obsidian seems to be working diligently to recover from the failed launch.\\n\\nUpdate 0.1.1.3: No noticable/documented changes.\\n\\nUpdate: 0.1.2: This update has added performance improvements and the devs have said that they will work on this in the future, that\\'s enough for me to change my review for the foreseeable future.',\n",

The roach queen also seems to be glitched in it\\'s animations, the acid seems to shoot sideways from her mouth and not properly pointing forward, tested the oversizzle effect as I\\'ll cal it, I ran all they way on a buggy to the ice area and that fixes it so if you don\\'t wanna die from oversizzle run to the ice on bugback\\n\\nPros: most everything else so far, more items n weapons, neat new bugs, the mount system which I take is what the originally wanted to make pets in the first game but didn\\'t for whatever reason, neat new map, new flora as well, it is pretty even though I had to gut the high level of graphics so hopefully they\\'ll optimize it as things roll out so I can see even better visuals at a good frame rate, there is also the streamlining of the \"utilities\" by making the shovel repair, axe, n hammer into one thing that doesn\\'t take inventory when that is already so limited.

              " 'Here is the edit of the review below. Much of what I said still stands. The game, overall is a blast, but a few negatives have surfaced over the past few hours. This might contain some spoilers.\\n\\nThere are many positives for the game and to list them all would spoil the game and become a very looong review, so the following negatives are much fewer. \\n\\nPositives are things like, very nice graphics. VERY NICE. The insects are better. They have personalities now, that are charming. All of them. Even the spiders. When an ant rears up on its hind-legs to protect itself, its almost disarmingly charming. This is a successful engagement. good job.\\n\\nThe resources are balanced, and the overall game play is super pleasant. finding a place to build is tricky however, and I miss by big rock from the first game. But that is just me. \\n\\nThere are so many positives. The weapons are neat. Very distinct. I would hope that the widow dagger make an appearance eventually. That was my favourite weapon in the last game. \\n\\nAgain, very positive game experience overall. Its all about the bugs, and the bugs are amazing. \\n\\nThe negatives:\\n\\n1) The antagonist in the game is constantly \\'testing\\' and trolling the player. Its really annoying and distracting. and by constantly, I mean for me its every few minutes. One of the longer spans I had without her provoking was about 15 minutes. She is constantly \"in your head\". And when she is not provoking, I am finding myself waiting for the next attack, and not wanting to get into things too much because she will just startup with you the minute you am busy.\\n\\nThe \\'good\\' boss of Ominent is someone you reach out to by computer, so you are able to time it out, but this antagonist is constantly provoking you wherever you are, and whatever you are doing. Even in the middle of a big fight with a wolf spider or some such she\\'ll pop in and start up with the hostility, and your screen goes all glitchy, in the middle of a fight. \\n\\n It even unbalances the game at times as if you are in a fight with a bug or two the antagonist might send several attack bugs to add to the mix, and suddenly you are surrounded by swarm of hostile bugs. This can be avoided if you are aware enough as a timer is counting down to her attack, but not if a hostile bug finds you first. Often it is something that ends with you dying far from a re-spawn point. For me, she really breaks the atmosphere of the game too, as she is constantly telling you you are a disappointment to her and how she wants you gone. Not a charming or pleasant villain.  I get she is the negative motivator, but  its very aggravating when you are exploring and finding something new, and your screen gets all glitchy and then she starts up with the insults.And again, its every few minutes, its demotivating. \\n\\nwhen one of her \\'tests\\' ends a few minutes later another test starts timing down, over and over.\\n\\n It becomes an \"oh... not again, sigh\" situation. I understand having an antagonist, and having it be motivating, but this, to me, is not. Far too often. Might be less apparent if she was less often. But I find it not very motivating. \\n\\nSecond and is fairly minor, the omni-tool. It needs its own hotkey. Often when I am playing along I will go to get onto my ride, and suddenly I whip out the tool to cut down stuff, or some such. Same with picking up things. Instead of the action I plan to do, the omni-tool dominates the action. I get that the game is early access and so I suspect this will change but a simple fix would be having the omni tool have its own hot button separate from the main action button. Same with accessing a chest. If I go to access a chest I will whip out the tool and fix it first. That is fine, but not what I expected.  \\n\\nThird, and this is minor, but when an insect is beaten, it will disappear fast. I took out a scorpion from a distance (on top of a box), and by the time I floated down to it it had vanished. Just a bit aggravating. Especially with hard to beat hostiles. No cockroaches around to eat it either. This has come up a few times.\\n\\nOverall the game is fun. Not sure why it is needing really modern computers with 16 gigs of ram. That limits access to newer machines. Many people I know can\\'t buy the game as a result. They played the old one and would love to play this one.  \\n\\n\\nOlder review:\\nI have put in a couple of hours, in the game, and its fun and very similar to the first, and the new elements they added are very welcome. Not sure about the omni-tool. Has not grown on me yet.\\nSo far the negatives are minor.\\nMy computer is an:\\n i3 10th gen,\\n 16 gigs of DDR 4\\n2060 \\nand on high settings its quite sluggish (no pun intended). The first game was smooth, but this one is low frame rate. I get below 30 frames at times, which is not pleasant but I don\\'t consider it a deal breaker as it was defiantly playable overall, and the game is very enjoyable so far.

He usually hides in his shell once you get too close and he will be invincible, well if you charge your attack fully then hit him before he hides, he\\'ll be stunned and you can damage him and then he\\'ll hide in his shell again, just walk away enough so he\\'ll come out and then charge hit him again and repeat until hes dead, giving you access to his T3 goo at T1.\\n\\nBut there are some really nice pros:\\nDodging is a well implemented mechanic.\\nDual Wield weapons are awesome.\\nWith the previously mentioned \"80% older/recycled early game content\". the other 20% is cool and unique, Mite Fangs into Mite Claws, Mite Hat for warmth, Grub Armor set, and a Pebblet War-Hammer, are all cool and welcome examples of new early game content.\\nYou can really tell that they\\'re leaning into more of a \"class concept\" instead of a weapon class concept that G1 had, my only complaint is the milk molar system is the exact same as G1, add some options that lean into class concepts, lunge distance, parry window, dodge distance, and dodge stamina drain are good ideas.\\nPete\\'s VA is really good, I assume this for all characters but they\\'re way more talkative and react to story elements, really good work!\\nThe game (if it runs well) looks really pretty!\\nThe Buggies are really well implemented and work great!

              " 'Grounded 2 review pre-release. \\n\\nAnon! Good, you\\'re here! You\\'ve found the good end route.. \\nToday is a blessed day. You\\'re alive, i\\'m alive, and we both have gotten lucky enough to witness the second coming of a truly unique, cared about, well develloped experience in game format! I, personally, did not expect this title to be made.. Grounded itself did pretty good for a completely new \"IP\", but at the end of the day, it wasn\\'t clear to many of us that a sequel would come, however, i\\'m glad it did. Grounded was well cared for, even well after release! Given SEVERAL actually big and loving updates.. I\\'m looking at you bethesda with your \"oh look a bad space car, and no mod API a year in!\"... For YEARS, we got blasted by obsidian who poured their heart into grounded one.. A game which i personally consider an absolute classic! The first of its kind, not first survival craft obviously but the KIND of experience it provided, the humor, the story within, the sheer.. Beauty of its crafted world. Now i\\'m not here to glaze grounded 1 all day, we\\'re here for this, obviously! \\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that, this is going to be quite a ride, thank you obsidian developers for your love of the craft. You are a shining gemstone amongst developers, something i personally admire! So before i continue; Thankyou, for this! \\n\\nLet us begin. I\\'d like any reader to know, this is a pre-review, and in the coming day, and also week, i\\'m going to update and edit this review based on my actual experience within the game and with it, so that you, if you are unsure of whether to get or support this yet? Whilst i absolutely do think you should and would recommend it, i fully understand it, and how some bad tier developers release slop and broken stuff all day long. So here\\'s the review for -you-!\\n\\n I will add a comprehensive list of potential issues i\\'ll encounter below as following\\nBugs encountered:\\n- Spinny character in stat screen\\n- light flickering on liquids\\n- some objects tend to get spawned underground or vanish (clay, meats, etc)\\nPerformance issues;\\n- slight framerate issues\\n- No DLSS on launch\\n- Pretty limited graphics settings\\nFlaws or generic issues:\\n- Crouch is alt and not ctrl? Weird design.\\n- cant huck spears any more?\\n- scroll wheel doesnt switch between attacks\\n- Looking down you cant see your body or armor, you can only see your legs/feet, which sint really a super big problem, would just like to have seeing your body, back!\\nRed flags (Example: DRM, p2w, so forth)\\n- Still windows login but you CAN play just offline/steam only. \\n\\nAnd then below this line i\\'ll give a more detailed review.\\n\\n- Let\\'s see about this! Diving in, bravo six.. Going dark..\\nAlright so we\\'re 2.5 ish hours in, it feels very much like a continuation of the first, but with some improvements, im missing some features though like throwing the spear? Perhaps im missing something, it does say in text and mutations you can, but the typical R button, or aiming+fire button doesnt work either. I\\'m loving the new addition of items, compared to the first. And im just about to get to the hatching parts of the game. Some things feel like they could potentially be sorted a bit better in terms of progression, but thus far its great. \\n\\nThe ONLY downside, as of right now, is sadly the performance. I\\'m on a good and high end system, with the most recent drivers, but somehow im getting like sub 30 fps on basically any of the ONLY 4 graphics settings, hopefully it\\'ll get fixed soon or a game ready driver for the game in particular, but its pretty bad framerate wise, the game beyond that plays well. But we are really missing those dlss and more specific graphics choices. \\n\\nNow, the game plays very much like the first, but if you\\'re new here, it feels fluid, great, and fun. You\\'ll have a blast, i assure you, and hopefully the performance is only for my card or something of the sort. But even if you set it to low the game looks great anyway ! Its a very immersive experience. If you\\'re new, try to just take it slow. You\\'re in no rush. It might feel that way! But just like the first, you really can take your time. Really get settled and make your little home! \\n\\nI dont really have much in particular to say as its still all fresh and most of it is exactly like grounded one, just with improvements. I love the quicker swap in UI and it feels much more sleek and pretty.\\n\\nOne negative thing i have to say though is, if you buy the founders edition, it isnt actually items, its literally just an option under gameplay that sets your outfit like \"transmog\" to it, so you cant mix and match which i was personally hoping for. I REALLY REALLY hope they change it to be actual items though! I think they were afraid people would call it pay to win if they gave the items stats and bonuses though.. So perhaps literally an individual armor piece transmog system would go great here! So even if you\\'re wearing an item you consider ugly you can perhaps change it to one you like. Way way would this feature go great in this game.\\n\\nThe omni tool is fun and great, i like it! Great new addition, however i kind of liked having to craft tools as well, more stuff to do and gather is fun, this might take a little bit out of that, but it also instead gives you more inventory space, and might feel better to players who just kinda wanna rush through and grind less. It\\'s a mixed bag i suppose! I\\'m okay with it.\\n\\nIt\\'s obviously extremely early access and please do take note of that, if you\\'re gonna play, and this company in particular is absolutely the GOAT of really putting in effort and throwing out great update after great update, so fret not! You can ABSOLUTELY safely purchase this and feel your money\\'s worth. JUST make sure right now you take note of the performance, it\\'ll get better im certain. \\n\\nI cant wait for more! Yes, i recommend this, go at it folks! \\n\\nThankyou for for reading! If you\\'d like to wait, come back to this review in a couple of a days and this review will have a lot more useful information for you to inform you if you should indeed support and spend your hard earned money on this! \\nHave a wonderful day.. I believe i, personally, will! \\n\\nThankyou, Obsidian!',\n",
              " \"The game is great, change my mind!\\n\\nFirst point to touch, DON'T compare it with Grounded 1, if you didn't play Grounded in it's alpha state. You have no reason to compare it with the current state of Grounded which is a complete developed game. Go and search Grounded early access and you will have a point of comparison. Where Grounded 2 still needs work but it's much better than grounded 1.\\n\\nSo now, the graphics are amazing, the gameplay feels fine for an early access. It's pretty polished compared to other games that are released early these days.\\nYes it is not very optimised, yes it doesn't have dlss nor fsr. But you can run it on a 4050 50fps on low settings with no problem, even on low the game looks great.\\nThis game has a lot of potential and the devs are giving us dopamine with nice updates and great ideas from the community. BECAUSE THEY LISTEN. So ofc I bought it in early access as I did with Grounded 1 so I can see how the game evolves and grows on the community.\\n\\nI recommend it, you have a lot of content already in the game, the map is huge and is released only 1/3 of it. It's very fun to play with friends, and it's up to you what you're doing in the game.\\n\\nfor the current state 8/10.(waiting for QOL updates)\"]"
